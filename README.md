# Clean-Slate-Prototype
This is a partial mock-up of custom wordpress theme being developed for the Clean Slate program of the YWCA Mclean County.

The index.html contains all of the html for a page of the theme.

The page_content.html file contains two examples of the content that might be displayed on the page. These can be copied and pasted into the main element of the index.html file to see how they would be displayed.
